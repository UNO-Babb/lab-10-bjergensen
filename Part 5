#between the two graphs it is easy to see that both Arabica and Robusta beans 
have an average score of about 80. I can also see from the bar scatter plot
that Robusta is more precisely rated around it's average, where Arabica is
less precise while still maintaining a similar average

It would take forever for me to read all of the numbers and create a mental
image in my head, so this is very convenient for visualization. It also helps
to see the precision on the scatter plot, where even if I found an average
via calcuations, I still wouldn't see how they are more spread out.
